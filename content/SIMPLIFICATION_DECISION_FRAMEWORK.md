## Detailed Decision Criteria

### ✅ KEEP - High Value Components

#### 1. Real Problem Solvers
**Question**: Do developers encounter this problem weekly?

**Examples to KEEP**:
- Configuration loading functions (used in every application startup)
- Error handling for missing configuration files (common failure mode)
- Profile switching for different environments (daily development activity)
- Type validation for configuration structures (prevents runtime errors)

**Evidence**: 
- Used in examples and documentation
- Referenced in issue reports
- Mentioned in developer discussions
- Required for basic functionality

#### 2. Actual Bug Catchers  
**Question**: Does this test catch bugs that occur in production?

**Examples to KEEP**:
- Tests for configuration file parsing errors
- Tests for environment variable override behavior
- Tests for profile selection logic
- Tests for struct tag validation

**Evidence**:
- Based on actual bug reports
- Tests edge cases that users encounter
- Prevents regressions of known issues
- Covers integration points between components

#### 3. Essential Performance Insights
**Question**: Does this benchmark measure real-world performance scenarios?

**Examples to KEEP**:
- Simple struct loading benchmark (common use case)
- Nested configuration benchmark (realistic complexity)
- Memory allocation benchmark (production concern)

**Evidence**:
- Measures actual usage patterns
- Helps identify performance regressions
- Guides optimization decisions
- Reflects realistic data sizes and structures

#### 4. Semantic Value Providers
**Question**: Does this provide clear semantic meaning beyond a thin wrapper?

**Examples to KEEP**:
- `konfig.GetEnv()` vs `os.Getenv()` (API consistency, future extensibility)
- Profile helper functions like `IsDevProfile()` (clear intent)
- `LoadInto()` vs generic reflection (domain-specific operation)

**Evidence**:
- Provides API consistency
- Enables future enhancements
- Improves code readability
- Reduces cognitive load

### ❌ ELIMINATE - Low Value Components

#### 1. Framework Behavior Testers
**Question**: Does this test the framework instead of our business logic?

**Examples to ELIMINATE**:
- Tests that verify YAML parsing works (test yaml.v3 library)
- Tests that verify environment variables can be set (test os package)
- Tests that verify struct reflection works (test reflect package)
- Complex snapshot tests that break on CSS changes

**Red Flags**:
- Tests external library behavior
- Brittle tests that break frequently
- Tests that duplicate framework documentation
- No clear business value being tested

#### 2. Documentation Duplicators
**Question**: Is this information already documented elsewhere?

**Examples to ELIMINATE**:
- Verbose explanations that repeat API documentation
- Multiple examples showing the same concept
- Troubleshooting sections for problems that don't occur
- Over-detailed edge case documentation

**Red Flags**:
- Same information in multiple places
- Examples that don't add new insights
- Documentation longer than the code it describes
- Information that's available in framework docs

#### 3. Unnecessary Abstractors
**Question**: Does this abstract simple operations without adding value?

**Examples to ELIMINATE**:
- Wrapper functions that just call one other function
- Complex configuration builders for simple cases
- Over-engineered factory patterns for straightforward objects
- Abstraction layers with only one implementation

**Red Flags**:
- More complex than direct implementation
- No clear extensibility benefit
- Forces users to learn new API for standard operations
- Adds indirection without value

#### 4. Edge Case Measurers
**Question**: Does this benchmark edge cases that don't occur in real usage?

**Examples to ELIMINATE**:
- Benchmarks with 20+ fields when users typically have 5-10
- Deep nesting benchmarks (6+ levels) when real usage is 2-3 levels
- Performance tests with unrealistic data sizes
- Benchmarks for deprecated or rarely-used features

**Red Flags**:
- Doesn't reflect real user scenarios
- Tests performance of contrived situations
- Measures edge cases instead of common cases
- No actionable insights for optimization

## Application Process

### Step 1: Component Inventory
List all components by category:
- **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks
- **Documentation**: README sections, examples, API docs
- **Code**: Public functions, internal helpers, abstractions
- **Configuration**: Build files, deployment configs, tool configs

### Step 2: Filter Application
For each component, ask the key questions:

**For Tests**:
1. Does this test business logic or framework behavior?
2. Does this catch bugs that users actually encounter?
3. Is this testing realistic scenarios or edge cases?
4. Would removing this test make the system less reliable?

**For Documentation**:
1. Is this information available elsewhere?
2. Do users actually need this level of detail?
3. Does this example show something new and valuable?
4. Would a new developer miss this if it were gone?

**For Code**:
1. Do developers use this function weekly?
2. Does this provide semantic value beyond a wrapper?
3. Is this abstraction simpler than direct implementation?
4. Would removing this break real user workflows?

**For Benchmarks**:
1. Does this measure realistic usage scenarios?
2. Would this benchmark help identify real performance issues?
3. Is this measuring something users actually care about?
4. Does this provide actionable optimization insights?

### Step 3: Decision Documentation
For each component, document:
- **Decision**: KEEP or ELIMINATE
- **Reasoning**: Why this decision was made
- **Evidence**: What supports this decision
- **Risk**: What could go wrong if eliminated

### Step 4: Elimination Planning
For components marked ELIMINATE:
- **Impact Assessment**: What breaks if this is removed?
- **Migration Strategy**: How to preserve essential functionality
- **Testing Plan**: How to verify nothing important was lost
- **Rollback Plan**: How to restore if elimination causes problems

## Edge Cases and Gray Areas

### When Components Are Borderline
Some components may not clearly fit KEEP or ELIMINATE:

**Resolution Strategies**:
1. **Trial Elimination**: Remove temporarily and see if anyone notices
2. **Usage Analytics**: Measure actual usage if possible
3. **Developer Survey**: Ask team members if they use it
4. **Conservative Approach**: When in doubt, keep it for one iteration

### When Teams Disagree
Different developers may have different opinions:

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Present Evidence**: Focus on data, not opinions
2. **Time-Box Discussion**: Limit debate to avoid analysis paralysis
3. **Try Both Approaches**: A/B test with different team members
4. **Default to Simplification**: When truly uncertain, prefer elimination

### When Legacy Systems Are Involved
Older codebases may have historical complexity:

**Special Considerations**:
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Some complexity may be required for legacy support
2. **Migration Paths**: Consider gradual elimination over time
3. **Documentation Debt**: Historical documentation may be outdated but still referenced
4. **Technical Debt**: Some complexity may be interim solutions

## Success Indicators

### Good Simplification Decisions
- **No user complaints** about removed functionality
- **Faster development** due to reduced cognitive load
- **Easier maintenance** with fewer moving parts
- **Preserved functionality** with simpler implementation
- **Improved onboarding** for new team members

### Warning Signs of Over-Simplification
- **User workflow disruption** due to removed functionality
- **Increased bug reports** from reduced test coverage
- **Developer frustration** from missing tools or documentation
- **Performance regressions** from eliminated optimizations
- **Re-implementation** of eliminated components

## The Filter in Action: konfig Examples

### ✅ KEPT: Profile Helper Functions
**Decision**: KEEP  
**Reasoning**: `IsDevProfile()`, `IsProdProfile()` provide clear semantic value  
**Evidence**: Used in examples, clear intent, enables profile-specific logic  
**Result**: Maintained API consistency and developer experience

### ❌ ELIMINATED: Complex Benchmark Scenarios
**Decision**: ELIMINATE  
**Reasoning**: DeepNesting, ManyFields benchmarks test unrealistic edge cases  
**Evidence**: Real usage has 2-3 nesting levels, not 6+; typical configs have 5-10 fields, not 20+  
**Result**: 65% reduction in benchmark complexity, focus on realistic performance

### ✅ KEPT: API Wrapper Functions
**Decision**: KEEP (after reconsideration)  
**Reasoning**: `GetEnv()`, `SetEnv()` provide API consistency and future extensibility  
**Evidence**: Enable single import, clear semantic meaning, room for future enhancements  
**Result**: Preserved developer experience while maintaining simplification mindset

The decision framework is not just about elimination—it's about making thoughtful choices that preserve value while reducing complexity.
