```markdown
## [MICRO-003] Remove Over-Engineered Benchmark Tests

- [ ] Remove BenchmarkComplexEdgeCase function
- [ ] Remove BenchmarkUnrealisticScenario function  
- [ ] Keep essential benchmarks (Simple, Nested, Memory)
- [ ] Verify remaining benchmarks still work

### Implementation Notes
- Delete specific benchmark functions from benchmark_test.go
- Keep benchmarks that measure real-world performance
- Preserve benchmark infrastructure and essential tests

### Verification Steps
- Run `go test -bench=.` to verify remaining benchmarks work
- Confirm essential performance scenarios still covered
- Check that complex edge case benchmarks are gone

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Edge case benchmarks removed
- [ ] Essential benchmarks preserved
- [ ] Benchmark suite still functional
- [ ] Code complexity reduced
```

### 4. Verification Tickets
**Purpose**: Ensure changes work correctly  
**Effort Level**: Lightning-fast  

```markdown
## [MICRO-004] Verify Test Consolidation Success

**Effort Level:** Lightning-fast  
**Type:** verification  
**Dependencies:** MICRO-002, MICRO-003  

### Problem Statement
Need to verify that test consolidation preserved all functionality without regressions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Code coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] No missing test scenarios
- [ ] Performance benchmarks still work

### Implementation Notes
- Run complete test suite with verbose output
- Check coverage report for any gaps
- Verify examples and integration tests work
- Run benchmarks to ensure they execute

### Verification Steps
- Execute `make test` and confirm 100% pass rate
- Run `make coverage` and review coverage report

- Execute `go test -bench=.` for benchmark verification

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage report clean
- [ ] Examples functional

```

### 5. Cleanup Tickets

## Micro-Ticket Best Practices

### Time Management
- **Keep it snappy**: Maintain lightning-fast execution
- **Single focus**: One concept per ticket
- **Complete in one session**: Avoid context switching
- **Stop at time limit**: Create new ticket if more work needed

### Quality Gates
- **Test immediately**: Verify each change works before moving on
- **Commit after completion**: Don't batch multiple micro-tickets
- **Document changes**: Note what was changed and why
- **Measure progress**: Track lines/files eliminated

### Risk Mitigation
- **Small changes**: Easy to revert if issues arise
- **Immediate feedback**: Test and verify each micro-change
- **Git discipline**: Commit frequently with clear messages
- **Preserve functionality**: Never break working features

### Dependency Management
- **Sequential execution**: Complete dependencies before starting new tickets
- **Clear prerequisites**: List exactly what must be done first
- **Parallel opportunities**: Identify tickets that can run in parallel
- **Blocked ticket handling**: Document and revisit when dependencies complete

## Success Patterns

### Effective Ticket Sequences
1. **Analysis** → **Consolidation** → **Verification** → **Cleanup**
2. **Multiple Analysis** → **Parallel Consolidation** → **Batch Verification**
3. **Elimination** → **Immediate Verification** → **Impact Documentation**

### Common Micro-Ticket Chains

#### Test Simplification Chain
```
MICRO-001: Analyze test complexity
MICRO-002: Consolidate basic tests  
MICRO-003: Consolidate advanced tests
MICRO-004: Eliminate edge case benchmarks
MICRO-005: Verify all tests work
MICRO-006: Update test documentation
```

#### Documentation Streamlining Chain
```
MICRO-007: Analyze documentation redundancy
MICRO-008: Consolidate README sections
MICRO-009: Simplify examples documentation  
MICRO-010: Verify examples still work
MICRO-011: Update references and links
```

## Measuring Micro-Ticket Success

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Completion rate**: >90% of tickets completed as expected
- **Functionality preservation**: 100% of tests pass after each ticket
- **Progress tracking**: Lines/files eliminated per ticket
- **Effort accuracy**: Task stayed within expected effort level

### Qualitative Indicators
- **Clear progress**: Tangible improvement after each ticket
- **Sustainable pace**: Can complete tickets in brief focused sessions
- **Low stress**: Changes feel safe and reversible
- **Maintained focus**: Single responsibility per ticket reduces cognitive load

The micro-ticket approach transforms large, risky simplification projects into manageable, low-risk improvements that provide immediate feedback and clear progress.
