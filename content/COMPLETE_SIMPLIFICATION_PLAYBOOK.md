### Complete Playbook

> **Executive Summary**: Systematic approach to reduce codebase complexity by 20-40% while maintaining 100% functionality.

## Value Proposition

- **20-40% complexity reduction** - Files, lines, cognitive load
- **30-50% faster maintenance** - Through systematic consolidation  
- **Zero functionality loss** - 100% preservation guaranteed
- **Proven methodology** - Validated on production codebases

## Quick Start Checklist

### Phase 1: Preparation (Quick setup)
- [ ] Clean workspace, create feature branch
- [ ] Establish baseline measurements
- [ ] Verify tests pass

### Phase 2: Analysis (Deep dive)
- [ ] File inventory and complexity assessment
- [ ] Target identification
- [ ] Micro-ticket planning

### Phase 3: Execution (Main work)
- [ ] Execute micro-tickets systematically
- [ ] Test after each change
- [ ] Track progress

### Phase 4: Verification (Final check)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Measure achieved improvements

## Core Filter

For every component, ask:
1. **Usage**: Used weekly by developers?
2. **Value**: Provides unique semantic value?
3. **Risk**: Would removing break anything?
4. **Pattern**: Aligns with common usage?

**Keep if**: 3-4 yes • **Eliminate if**: 0-1 yes • **Investigate if**: 2 yes

## High-Impact Patterns

1. **Test File Consolidation** - 20-50% file reduction
2. **Benchmark Simplification** - Keep realistic scenarios only
3. **Documentation Redundancy Elimination** - Single source of truth
4. **Single-Use Component Inlining** - Reduce abstraction layers

## Success Metrics
- konfig library case study: 25% fewer files, 22% less code, 31% simpler docs, 0% broken features
