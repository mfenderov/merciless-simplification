## üéØ Real-World Validation

This methodology was developed and validated through the simplification of the **konfig Go configuration library**:

### Achieved Results
- **File reduction**: 8 ‚Üí 6 test files (25% reduction)
- **Line reduction**: 1,075 ‚Üí 843 test lines (22% reduction)  
- **Documentation**: 673 ‚Üí 466 lines (31% reduction)
- **Benchmark optimization**: 251 ‚Üí 87 lines (65% reduction)
- **Functionality preservation**: 100%
- **Success score**: 8.2/10 (Excellent)

### Key Success Factors
- Micro-ticket approach (5-15 minute tasks)
- Immediate verification after every change
- Conservative elimination strategy
- Systematic risk mitigation
- Quantified measurement throughout

## üí° Core Philosophy

> "Keep what provides value, eliminate what doesn't. Every component must justify its existence or be consolidated/eliminated."

### The Simplification Filter
For every code component, ask:
1. **Usage**: Is this used weekly by developers?
2. **Value**: Does this provide unique semantic value?
3. **Risk**: Would removing this break anything?
4. **Pattern**: Does this align with common usage patterns?

**Keep if** 3-4 yes | **Eliminate if** 0-1 yes | **Investigate if** 2 yes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Agnostic
